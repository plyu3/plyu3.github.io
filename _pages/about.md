My name is Pumeng Lyu. I am currently a research assistant at Shanghai AI Laboratory. I am in the AI for Science track, where my work focuses on the interdisciplinary studies between generative AI and scientific discovery, especially promoting the development of Earth Science (e.g., climate forecasting) with Artificial Intelligence.

Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020, double major in [AMEP](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/applied-mathematics-engineering-physics-bs-amep/) and [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/undergraduate/undergrad-program-cs/). I got my masterâ€™s degree from the University of Chicago in 2021, majoring in physics. 

My enthusiasm extends to broad fields of AI, machine learning, and healthcare, particularly spanning the areas of multimodal data fusion, generative AI, large language models (LLM), and public health.

News
======
Our paper [MLP can be a Good Transformer Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05657) is on the final list in CVPR 2024. Thanks for my collaborators.

Our paper [ResoNet](http://www.iapjournals.ac.cn/aas/article/id/75268321-6e4a-4bf3-aa26-e3b500c7be72) is published in Advanced in Atomspheric Sciences (AAS) as special issue [AI Applications in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science: Pioneering the Future](http://www.iapjournals.ac.cn/aas/en/topic?id=9134e796-acef-402e-8c28-dcd05c6816d3). A lot of thanks to my collegues.

We introduce [ORCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15412), the first deep-learning powered climate seasonal forecasting model aiming to resolve long-term climate simulations.

Starting in August 2022, I will be a research assistant at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4/mycompany/).

My project proposal received my [Hilldale Research Fellowship](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/2019-cs-department-awards/) in April 2019, thanks a lot to Prof. Robert McDermott.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

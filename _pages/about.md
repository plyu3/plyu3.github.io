My name is Pumeng Lyu. I am currently a research assistant at Shanghai AI Laboratory. I am in the AI for Science track, where my work focuses on the interdisciplinary studies between generative AI and scientific discovery, especially promoting the development of Earth Science (e.g., climate forecasting) with Artificial Intelligence.

Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020, double major in [AMEP](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/applied-mathematics-engineering-physics-bs-amep/) and [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/undergraduate/undergrad-program-cs/). I got my masterâ€™s degree from the University of Chicago in 2021, majoring in [physics](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/academics/academic-departments/). 

My enthusiasm extends to broad fields of AI, machine learning, and healthcare, particularly spanning the areas of multimodal data fusion, generative AI, large language models (LLM), and public health.

News
======
Our paper [MLP can be a Good Transformer Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05657) is on the final list in CVPR 2024. Thanks for my collaborators.

Our paper [ResoNet](http://www.iapjournals.ac.cn/aas/article/id/75268321-6e4a-4bf3-aa26-e3b500c7be72) is published in Advanced in Atomspheric Sciences (AAS) as special issue [AI Applications in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science: Pioneering the Future](http://www.iapjournals.ac.cn/aas/en/topic?id=9134e796-acef-402e-8c28-dcd05c6816d3). A lot of thanks to my collegues.

We introduce [ORCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15412), the first deep-learning powered climate seasonal forecasting model aiming to resolve long-term climate simulations.

Starting in August 2022, I will be a research assistant at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4/mycompany/).

My project proposal received my [Hilldale Research Fellowship](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/2019-cs-department-awards/) in April 2019, thanks a lot to Prof. Robert McDermott.

Research Interests
------
1. Physics behind Neural Networks
   The CNN model proposed by [Ham et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1559-7) opens the new research   of improving the accuracy of climate forecasts with deep learning methods.
   [NeuralGCM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07744-y) is a new benchmark for the hybrid modeling of climate.
2. LLM-based knowledge
   Understand the knowledge expression from LLM is not easy. Fetching scientific knowledge from LLM-based agent system is even harder. Current generative AI methods are mainly on biological sciences. 
3. Universal Scientific Expression
